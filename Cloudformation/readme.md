## What is IAC?
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice that involves managing and provisioning IT infrastructure using code files, rather than manual configurations. This means that instead of performing tasks manually through the management console or graphical interfaces, infrastructure is defined using programming languages such as YAML or JSON. Tools like AWS CloudFormation then interpret these files and automatically create or modify resources in the cloud.

## What is CloudFormation?
AWS CloudFormation is an AWS service that allows you to define and manage AWS infrastructure as code, following the IaC concept. With CloudFormation, you can create and update resources in an automated and consistent manner, using templates that describe the infrastructure you want to implement. These templates are files in YAML or JSON format that contain the configuration of resources, their properties, and relationships between them.

## Benefits of AWS CloudFormation
- Automation and consistency: CloudFormation automates resource deployment and management, ensuring consistent configuration across all environments.
- Versioning and change control: Allows control and management of template versions, as well as tracking changes in infrastructure.
- Reusability: Templates can be reused in different environments (development, testing, production), facilitating infrastructure replication.
- Scalability: Allows efficient scaling of infrastructure by defining resources and their configurations in templates.
- Simplified monitoring: Facilitates monitoring and management of infrastructure by centralizing configuration in code files.

## Key Concepts of CloudFormation
- Templates: Files in YAML or JSON format that describe the infrastructure to be implemented.
- Stacks: Unique instances of a template. Each time you deploy a template, you create a stack.
- Resources: Individual components of the infrastructure, such as EC2 instances, security groups, etc.
- Parameters: Values that can be passed to the template during stack creation to customize the configuration.
- Outputs: Values generated by the template that can be useful outside the stack, such as URLs, IDs, etc.
- References: Mechanisms to reference other resources within the template, establishing dependencies and relationships.
- Update Policy: Policies that define how CloudFormation should handle updates to existing resources.
- Rollback: Mechanisms to revert a stack to its previous state in case of failures during updates.
